 Samuel Beckett's Whitting Fragato premiered on January the 3rd, 1953 at a very small theater in Paris called the Fiatra Dubabal√≥n. According to Beckett's biographer James Nolson, the play became a hit only after and because it upset many
 among its first audiences. At the Paris premiere, a group of well-dressed hagglers forced the curtain to come down after Lucky's monologue, and the play was put on hold for that performance. At the London premiere two years later, a spectator shouted out in the middle of the play. This is why we lost the colonies.
 When the ester gone at the same performance in London asked Vladimir if he has any rope with which they could hang themselves. Somebody in the audience yelled, for God's sake, give him some.
 At the opening night of the American premiere, which was of all places in Miami, much of the audience simply left at the intermission.
 So let's jump ahead and to a very different kind of audience for the play. This is the 19th of November 1957. This is a story told by Martin Ezland in his book, The Theater of the Obserred.
 So a small group of very worried actors, 19th of November,
 are waiting behind a curtain in the dining hall at San Quentin Penitentiary in California.
 California. They are about to perform the first live play at San Quentin in over 40 years. And it is waiting for Gato. They chose it mostly because it did not require women actors. The difficulty of using women actors inside of maximum security
 present. So the curtain is about to rise on an audience that is made up of 1,400 of the toughest men on the planet.
 And a young San Francisco theater group is going to perform a highly obscure avant-garde French play in which absolutely nothing happens.
 I play that when it premiered in for sophisticated theater ideas is angered and upset them.
 The director Herbert Blau decides that he will try to prepare his audience a bit for what's coming.

 whatever you can. The curtain parts, the play starts, and according to several witnesses who were there and have written about a 1400 hardened convicts are riveted in their seats.
 and they remain that way throughout the performance of the play.
 They get it. Instantly.
 What had be willedered and angered sophisticated theater audiences made immediate sense to an audience of convex at a maximum security prison.
 Why? Why did the prisoners at San Quentin
 penitentiary immediately grasp waiting for God.
 Well, one answer, perhaps it was because the prisoners saw themselves in this play, that these are men who knew what it meant to wait, who knew what it meant to be deprived of everything but waiting.
 That's possible. But my guess is you could have shown these prisoners a play about waiting that would have started to real riot, not a theater riot, a prison
 ride. I think the main reason that those prisoners identified with this play and why they themselves started a theater true baff to which to perform back its plays in the prisons is that back its plays are utterly and completely without pretense.
 Samuel Beckett did not have for all of his reputation as an avant-garde playwright, simply did not have a potential spawning his body.
 And it doesn't have potentials word anywhere in his writings.
 It pains me to say this more than you will know.
 But that is simply not true of T.S. Eliot or Virginia Wolf. Imagine reading the way slad to those prisoners of
 and the land quanta. Imagine reading to the lighthouse to those prisoners.
 One of Beckett's early characters asks himself this question.
 Was it to be laughter or tears? It came to the same thing in the
 What I think that means is this that what laughter and tears have in common is that they dissolve pretence.
 the cut-through poses. Lapturing tears force us to take off whatever mask it is that we happen to be wearing and they leave a exposed, you know laughing or crying, if only for a moment. Getting to that moment when the masks are off.
 When everything has been revealed, if only for a moment is what drove Samuel Beckett as an artist. He was repeatedly attracted to characters who have been stripped of pretense by age or by circumstance.
 If I have my youth or my health or an important job or just a nice car, it's a lot easier for me to forget that I'm going to die, that I was born like all of you with my mother, straddling the grave and Samuel Beckett's unforgettable image. But if I've lost all of that, if I'm homeless, I'm sick or I'm old, then very little else is likely to matter to me other
 of kings if I'm starving. It's the same tactic that was used in film by one of Beckett's loves and that's Charlie Chaplin. Use the tramp, use the man's stripped of everything to go beneath
 because they wrote without pretence in an unpretentious language. Chaplain and Beckett spoke about his close to a universal language as it is possible for art to get. It's language that is utterly incompletely stripped of ornament. That's why in the 1930s Charlie Chaplain was the most famous man in the world. At his 19th
 31 meeting with Gandhi, the crowds were beatled sized and they're screaming for Charlie, not for Gandhi. It's why the little tramp is still the most recognized fictional character in the world. He doesn't even need language. And it's why Beckett became a celebrity in the 1950s. And why even today Beckett has more fan sites
 on the internet than any of the authors we are looking at in this series. Almost all of them run by amateurs, not by professional critics, real fans, one of them to which I would direct your attention, just Google waiting for Gido and Guinea Pigs. Waiting for Gido and Guinea Pigs. It's a performance of waiting for Gido by Guinea Pigs.
 Waiting for God is the most clear, the most truthful play that I know.
 The question is not why the prisoners at San Quentin saw that or something like
 The question is why I sophisticated theater audiences. People who would go to see a new play and a von Kard play at a very small theater by then largely unknown writer did not see that.
 Well, from Martin Eslem, the likely answer is their sophistication. That is that unlike those prisoners, the first sophisticated educated audiences of Godo came to it loaded with expectations about what a play should be and do.
 We didn't forget to upset those expectations and so therefore upset those audiences.
 To an educated audience, the shock of this play isn't so much that it broke with dramatic conventions. It's more that it threw those conventions in its audience as well as you get it faces. For instance, waiting for Gato actually follows all three of the so-called classical unities, the three unities for the stage that exist in very fragmented form in Aristotle's Poetics.
 and returned into rules for the theater much later. The play follows it uses plausibly connected actions. Each action is connected to the other, the unity of action. It takes place in a concentrated period of time. Aristotle had said merely in passing that a action and a play should attempt to confine itself to a single daylight period that became the rule of the unity of time, which the play follows.
 It takes place in a single setting. Unity of
 place. But even though the play follows those classical universities, it follows the rules only to float the very spirit of the rules.
 Traditional drama represents action. What Aristotle said drama is, it is the representation of an action.
 Godo is about inaction. It's about waiting for an action that never happens.
 Probably the most quoted line about this play from an early Irish reviewer. Beckett has written a play in which nothing happens twice.
 Time in this play is not so much concentrated the way the Unity's urge as it is undifferentiated. In this play, one moment is no different from the next. It's all the same suffering. It takes place in a single setting, but it is a setting that is almost completely removed from the real world.
 So, waiting for Godo follows the unity of action in a play with that action.
 It follows the unity of time in a play without time. And it follows the unity of place in a play that is no place.

 both acts. Time has passed. That is what Beckett said he meant by the appearance of a few leaves on the tree in between
 the acts. But unlike in Virginia Wost, the lighthouse, the passage of time does not bring any kind of resolution, any kind of vision, the vision that we get in Lily's painting, for instance.
 There's no die. There's no answer. No deeper resolution for the characters or for us.
 The last page of the play, my favorite lines in the play, Esther gone, I can't go on like this. Vladimir, that's what you think.
 But the thing is this, Godo, the play, did not upset traditional drama, so much as it just picked that it's scabs.
 This was hardly the first play that educated theater audiences would have seen to subvert the classical unities. It was not even close to the first play that they could have seen that would use dialogue that is punctuated by repetition and by silences. They could have learned all that from check-off among others.
 There are some obvious causes for the hostility of the place for the audience. Things that probably should not be discounted. It's vulgarity. It's repetition. Specific circumstances in the different premier. At the Paris premier, the actor who played Lucky,
 modeled lucky after a patient of a friend of his who had Parkinson's disease. Apparently, it was a very horrifying performance. That may be part of it. In Miami, the play was rather mistakenly billed as the laugh sensation of two continents. So audiences didn't get what they expected. So there may well be specific reasons for these things.
 But I think what really confused and angered, educated audiences about waiting for God out, is its neglect of longstanding and deeply important hierarchies between dramatic audiences and their characters.
 This is a player that was in his build on the title page as a tragic comedy. And tragic comedy is pretty much like what it sounds, a hybrid of tragedy and comedy.
 Comedy traditionally relies on its audience's superiority to its characters.
 Right? Our laughter from above at all of their silly mistakes. The hierarchy of comedy. Tragedy is schizophrenic because on the one hand, tragedy demands an audience that is inferior to its hero. The hero of tragedy is the best of his kind.
 A king, the higher they come, the harder they fall. So in the one hand, they are above us. But the audience of tragedy is also superior to the hero, in one very crucial respect. And that is that we know something he does not. We know the downfall that is going to become
 I eat a piss whom all men call great. On the first audience is that play, whenever you're in to that play, here's those words, they know what eat a piss does not know. Those lines are deeply ironic, because we know more than eat a piss does. We know what's coming. That's called dramatic irony. Waiting for Godo refuses to play by the rules of either of its generic parents.
 If you feel, comedy is superiority, to go go and deity, you have seriously misunderstood the play and probably yourself.
 None of these characters come across as superior to us and certainly not as the best of their kind. And most important of all, we do not get to watch these characters make their mistakes from above them. Secure in the knowledge that we know more than they do because we don't.
 There's no dramatic irony in this play. No superior knowledge for us as audience. Now for an educated theater gore, it is perfectly okay for edipus. The tragic character, not to see what is going on, not to know. It's okay that edipus can't see or doesn't know that he murdered his father.
 that it's him who slept with his mother. But the audience has to know that, in tragedy, themselves. The reason that we have to know more than the hero does is to allow us to experience the cruel pleasure of dramatic irony. The certain knowledge that you are doomed, and I know it, but you don't.
 That's the pleasure of tragedy. And it's a cruel pleasure as Nietzsche among others have pointed out.
 And waiting for God, they did not get that. They did not get to feel superior to its character.

 line. The convicts had sandquainted on the other hand, were clearly comfortable with that. Maybe because they had daily evidence the Posa was right, but that is indeed how it is on this bitch of an earth.
 Maybe because they did not feel that they needed to know more about life than a couple of trams.

 After the war, Beckett volunteered in a red cross-hospital in the South of France as an interpreter. Imagine the stories he must

 English. But Beckett himself said that abandoning the language of English literature freed him from the necessity of style. It allowed him to give up excess color, style, all the baggage of the English literary style.
 What it did, I think, was it freed him from the weight of literary history?
 His decision to write in France is a kind of wild amnesia that allowed him to simply start over again, to start literary history at zero with Beckett.
 After the war, he wrote several novels and his most famous play, Anna Tundra Gado, which he translated in English himself as Waiting for Gado.
 The play made him famous. He became the name in dramatic and literary circles, especially but not only in Paris. He won the Nobel Prize in 1969, refused to attend the ceremony and gave away the prize money to charity and to friends.
 This is my favorite photograph of Beckett. He died in 1989.
 So, Beckett consciously set about forgetting the past.
 by writing in a foreign language. In the play, that amnesia seems something that has happened to his characters rather than something they chose to do.
 Esther gone cannot remember from day to day if it been here before. If they've met each other before, if goto has come or not, and Vladimir's memory is not much better. It is condition that afflix everybody in the play. When Pozo returns in Act 2, he doesn't remember meeting Vladimir and Esther gone. When the boy returns a little later, he doesn't remember.
 Esther God speaks to Pozo. You're not Mr. Godo sir? Pozo. I am Pozo. Pozo. Does that name mean nothing to you? I say does that name mean nothing to you?
 Bozo? Bozo? Pozo? Pozo? Pozo? Pozo? Ah, Pozo. Let me see, Pozo. Is it Pozo or Bozo? I want a new family called Gozo, the mother had the clasp.
 The memory loss here is more than just theirs. It's cultural amnesia, it's not just personal or individual. This is something that has happened to this world, this is science.
 early in the play.
 Vladimir says, hope deferred, make it for something sick.
 who said that? Well, it's from Proverbs that he couldn't remember that is itself not terribly surprising. But a few moments later, Vladimir says to Esther gone, did you ever read the Bible as to Grana? The Bible.
 I must have taken a look at it. And you don't forget reading the Bible. You've either read it or he's not. He can't even remember this book, not what is in it. It's similar in a way to the wasteland where literature and myth have been empties of me.

 This is Poso. He's explaining the twilight. Ah yes, the night, but be a little more attentive for pity's sake otherwise will never get anywhere. Look, we look at the sky, pig, to lucky.

It begins to lose its effulgence to grow pale, pale, ever a little paler, a little paler until...pff...finished. It comes to rest. But? But behind this veil of gentleness and peace, night is charging, and will burst upon us like that, just when we least expect it.
 Western art loves the sunset. It has always loved the sunset. This time of day, think of the thousands of poems, the thousands of paintings, the movies that end with sunsets. It's a time of peace, a time of beauty and stillness. The sunset appeals to art because there's a moment in between times, the twilight.

 and a entire human life in 40 seconds. That's all I can take to stage breath. It's a
 cheap play for the actors. Even if words don't work, even if language does not work in this play. The characters in waiting for Godow still long to hear the word. They're still waiting for Godow, despite everything. They're staying and they're waiting for him. Still hoping that something

 It's the same reason. He suggests committing suicide merely to pass the time.
 And it's the same reason I think that Vladimir keeps looking inside his hat. There's never been anything in there before, but who knows, maybe this time there will be something in there. It's the reason that they so want lucky to speak.
 to pass the time, but also on the off chance that something meaningful will come out of Lucky's mouth. But when Lucky does speak in his famous and terribly difficult to perform monologue, all that comes out is gibberish. It's half forgotten scholarship, fragments of pseudo-knowledge, all of which adds up to absolutely now
 Nothing. Lucky speech is a great deal like the factory scene, the factory in Charlie Chaplin's modern time. That factory in modern times is tremendously busy. Everybody's busy making something, but nobody watching the film has any idea what the factory actually makes, what the product is. It's just noise and machines moving without producing anything.
 Mostly, what Vladimir and Astra on our waiting for is Gato? Who is Gato? Well, he's the person that Vladimir and Astra on our waiting for.
 After Beckett won the Nobel Prize, he got a postcard from a Monsieur George Gado in Paris. And he wrote Beckett to say how sorry he was that he'd kept him waiting all these years.
 When the director of the first American performance of the play asked Beckett who or what goto meant Beckett said, if I knew I would have said so in the play.
 Now, for a great number of readers and audience members, God was God. And the fact that he never shows up is a comment on the disappearance of God and religion from the post-war world.
 For one of the prisoners at San Quentin, God O was society. For another one of the prisoners, God O was the outside world.
 I think God is a general symbol in the sense that Virginia Walsh Lighthouse is a general symbol. That is, it does not have a particular symbolic reference. It means different things to different people.
 To me, what Garo means is any belief system that promises a complete explanation.
 God, yes, but also, Da. Also, the sacred scriptures that Lily believes are inside Mrs. Ramsey. Also, science. Anything at all that promises a complete explanation or answer to life. That's what we're waiting for.
 What really matters though in this play, I think, is not who or what God is. It's the fact that we're all waiting for God.
 See, action helps us to ignore time. It's easier to ignore the passage of time if you're busy, if you're pushed about by causality. Waiting forces us, characters and audience to confront
 time. To be aware of its passage, to remember as the play forces you to that we are all born with our mothers to strive to grave.
 Now we tend to forget this because the secret to life is just to keep on going. Just to keep on doing what we do out of habit of nothing else.
 Vladimir, a stride of a grave and a difficult birth. Down in the hole, lingeringly, the grave digger puts on the four seps. We have time to grow old. The air is full of our cries, but habit is a great

 Lovely image. Breathing is habit. Life is habit. Rarely does one experience the moment when the boredom of living is replaced by the suffering of being
 being. That is what Samuel Beckett is aiming at, always dim it, did I not, the dramatization of action of all the things that we do out of habit, but the dramatization of a condition, the suffering
 of being. That suffering is one reason why this is quite often called an existentialist
 play. It says so on the back of the grove edition that this is
 an existentialist play. I don't think so. At heart, I do not think this is an existentialist play at all.
 the basic principle of existentialist ethics.
 is that we are what we make of ourselves.
 In John Paul'siatrist famous phrase, existence precedes essence.
 what is meant here by saying that existence proceeds
 It means that, first of all, man exists, turns up, appears on the scene, and only afterwards defines himself. Thus, there is no human nature, since there is no God to conceive it. Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself. Such is the first
 First principle of existentialism. But if existence really does, precede essence, man is responsible for what he is.
 What such a means is that the only person who is responsible for your actions, for the life that you make, is you. There is no predetermined path. There's no such thing as human nature. And that is what existentialist angst is. The realization that you are completely on your own. And that there is no one else. No God. But nothing else either.
 Waiting for God, oh, shares that existential ang.
 There is no superior knowledge for the characters. No God for us or the characters.
 No answers. It's not just that God oh never speaks. Never gives an answer like, DAH or well done. God oh never even shows up.
 So, waiting for Gideaux represents something that is very close to the existential spirit, the existential condition, which is hardly surprising, since they both grew out of the same soil and that is occupied France. But the play is not existentialist, if you see
 the difference. Because it does not share the hope that Sartra found in the wreckage, and that is humanity's radical freedom to find our own answers, to create our own essences, to make ourselves
 Early in the play. Vladimir tells Astrgorn, a story from the Bible, story from the Gospel of Luke, story about the two
 Let me hear. Two thieves, crucified at the same time as our Savior, one are what? Our Savior. Two thieves. One is supposed to have been saved in the other
 I am damned. Save from what? Hell, I'm going. He does not move
 And yet how is it? This is not boring you I hope. How is it that of the four evangelists only one speaks of a thief being saved? The four of them were there or thereabouts. And only one speaks of a thief being saved. Come on, go and return the ball. Can't you once in a way? I find this really most extraordinarily interesting.
 Esther gone comes back a few moments later. Look, the evangelist don't agree, and that's all there is to it. Vladimir, but all four were there, and only one speaks of a thief being saved. Why believe him rather than the others? Esther gone. Who believes him? Vladimir, everybody. It's the only version they know. Esther gone. People are bloody ignorant apes.
 Three different takes on this story, okay? The classic Christian interpretation of the story that you just heard in fragments is by St. Augustine. St. Augustine says that the story of the thieves means this. Do not despair. One of the thieves was saved.
 Do not presume what the thieves was damned.
 That's the lesson. For Augustine, this story is a lesson in the wonder and the uncertainty of grace, the gift of God's
 love that you cannot presume, but you also do not need to despair.
 To an existential, it's like, socturately, that is nonsense.
 This thief chose to be a thief, and that's why he's hanging up there on the cross. Most important to an existentialist, there is no mysterious force like grace deciding in advance our essence, deciding that some of us are saved and some of us are damned.
 Now, what does the story mean to go go in D.D? Not much. It is just another story to pass the time. Esther and Barley cares enough to listen. And Vladimir is more interested in why only one of the four apostles tells the story than in why one thief was saved and the other was damned.
 The story simply has no relevance to their lives.
 Vladimir even has to struggle to remember what the opposite of saved is. He can't remember what damned is.
 meaning. So all I do is suffer and play games to fill up the void.
 Waiting for God, though, does not show humans controlling time, freely shaping their own destiny. The way an existentialist should. It shows humans enduring time. What we're like, what we're like, I should say, when we've got nothing left but time, which is the
 say all the time, I can't go on like this, says Esturon.
 That's what you think says Vladimir. That is what theater Adorno said was the only consolation in Beckett's place. The only fragment of hope that has left in these plays.
 stoicism, toughness, survival.
 I can't go on like this. That's what you think. Yes, you can.
 beginning with Martin Eslen, a very long line, excuse me, of critics and classroom teachers, have attempted to diffuse Vladimir's bombshell by saying that he and Estagorn are not good, existentialists. That is that this is a critique of them. The Vladimir and Estagorn are avoiding, but the possibility of being a part of the world is not a part of the world.
 But the problem with reading, waiting for God, though, as a criticism of its characters, existentialist or otherwise, is that it makes us the audience superior to those characters.
 It makes the play depend on not only what it does not have, but what it doggedly and determinately rejects. And that's dramatic irony. The giving of more knowledge to us than the characters inside the play.
 If the play did endorse existentialism, if it was, as it is repeatedly claimed to be an existentialist play, that would mean that one religion, one explanation, has survived, and the play is about the loss of all explanations. All answers, including
 is a potentialism. Not just the outdated answers, but also the fashionable answers. That's what I meant by Beckett being utterly without pretense that he could turn his back on the fashionable as well as the dated.
 Waiting for God O is not about God O. It's about waiting. The first word is the word that matters. It's not about answers. It's about enduring without answers. I can't go on like this. That's what you
 think. These are the last words the Beckett ever wrote from the stage from a play called What Where 1983.
